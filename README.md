LLM Engineering - Master AI and LLMs
We will start the course by installing Ollama so you can see results immediately!

1. Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com noting that on a PC you might need to have administrator permissions for the install to work properly
2. On a PC, start a Command prompt / Powershell (Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter). On a Mac, start a Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
3. Run ollama run llama3.2 or for smaller machines try ollama run llama3.2:1b - please note steer clear of Meta's latest model llama3.3 because at 70B parameters that's way too large for most home computers!
4. If this doesn't work: you may need to run ollama serve in another Powershell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and try step 3 again. On a PC, you may need to be running in an Admin instance of Powershell.
